# DamparoPortfolio
Created a preliminary portfolio website to practice html/CSS.  The site will serve as the foundation to build and customize different features as the class progresses.
Going forward with this site, I plan on adding a better color scheme, making it more functionable, adding quality images to highlight my projects and interests, and making sure my layout/spacing is good.
